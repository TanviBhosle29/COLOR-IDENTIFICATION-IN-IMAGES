**COLOR IDENTIFICATION IN IMAGES**


**TASK:** Identify the colors from the picture.

**About:**
I had used one jpg picture. Firstly I converted the image into RGB format then converted into HSV format. Then to find yellow color I had given range for yellow color and found mask and detect yellow color. Same way we can find any color.
